<h2>Do our choices matter?</h2>
<p> <i>
In Mr. Nobody, one of the biggest decisions for Nemo comes when his parents get a divorce. He is faced with the impossible choice of whether to stay with his dad or go with his mom. At this point in the movie, Nemo’s life splits off into different “realities.” One reality where he stays with his father, and one where he boards the train and leaves with his mother. Nemo lives out both of these lives where he experiences different things. Some things only being experienced depending on which parent he chose to live with. It appears that Nemo has different levels of happiness in each reality, but as it seems, no one reality has more meaning than the other. </p> <br>
 <p>Our choices set our lives in a certain direction and ultimately lead us to our present selves. There were several choices for Nemo:<i> </p>

 <h2>Mr. Nobody Ending Explained</h2>
 <p>Mr. Nemo, the 118 year old man narrates our adventure back through his life. But Nemo tells the journalist that has come to learn about the oldest mortal man still living that neither of them actually exist. Why? Well, because, the entirety of the movie is occurring in the mind of a nine year old standing on a train platform trying to figure out what he should do in the moment of his parents divorce and separation.And it is there, on the platform that Nemo realizes that going with either parent won’t work. That there has to be another way. And so Nemo leaves the platform and ultimately finds Anna, and lives his life happily with her.<br> For watching the movie online click <a href="https://www.popcornflix.com/movie/18-vj2krcxvg2ww-mr-nobody?channel=most-popular"> here. </a>
